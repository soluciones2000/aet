English :
Assignment of the sophia dacade course, consists of a prepaid card and has two options to reload and / or consume

This submission is a small part of a payment application with prepaid cards, for academic purposes I have simplified it. It consists of a first form where a card is generated with a call to a smart contract, then you can make consumptions or top up the balance to that card and in both cases make calls to the smart contract. The idea is to show a real application of interaction with the smart contract.
